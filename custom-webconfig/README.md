# Customizing your Java app using web.config

If your Java app running on Azure App Service, needs control over the JVM launch parameters to configure the heap, to specify some environment variables, etc you can use a `web.config` file to do that. Refer the `web.config` file in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/azureappserviceoss/tomcat) that is configured to use a custom Tomcat version.
